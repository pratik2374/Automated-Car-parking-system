## **Features**
- **Real-time Vehicle Detection**: Uses YOLOv8 to identify incoming vehicles and capture license plates via OCR.
- **Automated Parking Management**: Determines parking slot availability using ultrasonic sensors.
- **Smart Entry & Exit Control**: If a parking slot is available, the system opens the gate automatically.
- **Cloud-Based Data Storage**: Stores vehicle entry and exit details in a database.
- **Live Slot Display**: An LCD screen at the entrance shows real-time slot availability.
- **IoT Communication**: Uses ESP32 to communicate with the cloud via Flask and ThingSpeak.
- **Web Interface**: Displays processed data using a Flask web app.

## **Installation**

```bash
1) Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/SaranshGupta02/Automated-Parking-System.git
cd Automated-Parking-System

2) Install Dependencies
pip install flask ultralytics opencv-python pytesseract requests

3) Set Up Tesseract
# Download and install Tesseract OCR from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
# Then update the path in `app.py`
# Example:
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'

4) Run the Application
python app.py

5) go to okwi simulator and clone the file

```

## **API Endpoints**
| Endpoint         | Method | Description                                                       |
|-----------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/`             | GET    | Renders the homepage                                            |
| `/process_images` | GET    | Detects vehicles, extracts license plates, and retrieves parking slot info |

## **Workflow**
1. Load 5 images (in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` format).
2. YOLO model detects vehicles (Car, Van, Truck, Bus, Motorcycle, Bicycle).
3. If a vehicle is detected:
   - YOLO model detects the license plate.
   - OpenCV extracts the bounding box.
   - Tesseract OCR reads the plate number.
4. Send vehicle detection data to ThingSpeak.
5. The ESP32 retrieves the available parking slots by ultrasonic sensors
6. If parking slot is available then display the slot number on screen and sent data to ThingSpeak.
7. Wait 10 seconds for parking slot data update.
8. Retrieve slot information from ThingSpeak.
9. Display detected vehicle, license plate, and slot information in the web interface.

## **How It Works**
1. The system loads and processes images using YOLO.
2. If a vehicle is detected, the license plate is extracted via OCR.
3. The detection data is sent to ESP32 via Thingspeak.
4. The ESP32 retrieves the available parking slots by ultrasonic sensors
5. If parking slot is available then display the slot number on screen and sent data to ThingSpeak.
6. The data is displayed in the Flask web interface.

## **Comparison With Existing similar Tech**
The graph shows that YOLOv8, which we used for object detection, achieves a 94% accuracy. This is significant because itâ€™s comparable to many of the other systems and even better than a few. Unlike systems that rely on predefined outputs, YOLOv8 uses AI to detect objects in real-time, adapting to different situations and conditions. This shows that our approach is very reliable, even when compared to other models that also use AI or a combination of sensors.
